# itschool-weather
My second project from my web development course @ IT School, this time using JS as well. The website provides real-time weather information using the OpenWeather API.
Its main functionalities include:

Location Selection:
Users can choose a desired location from a dropdown menu containing a predefined list of cities or regions.

Current Weather Display:
Once a location is selected, the website displays current weather conditions, such as:
-Temperature
-Weather status (e.g., clear, cloudy, rain)
-Wind speed
-RealFeel

5-Day Weather Forecast:
The website provides a 5-day forecast, showing:
-Daily average temperatures
-General weather conditions for each day
-Weather icons for visual clarity

OpenWeather API Integration:
All weather data is fetched in real time through a direct integration with the OpenWeather API, ensuring accuracy and frequent updates.

Responsive and User-Friendly Interface:
The website is optimized for various screen sizes, offering a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
